# Product Grid UI Example

This is a Vanilla JS experiment that entails building a user interface for displaying products.

Product data is mocked via `src/components/MockProductData.js`.

## Installation

Make sure you have the following on your system:

- Node.js (10+)
- NPM (6+)

Optional, but recommended:

- Visual Studio Code
- [VSCode ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint)
- [VSCode npm Intellisense](https://github.com/ChristianKohler/NpmIntellisense)

The usual routine, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Folder Structure

- `dist/`: distributable files generated by Parcel
- `src/`: source files of your app

## Commands

The following npm scripts are available to you:

- `npm run format`: run Prettier on all source files.
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint on all source files.
- `npm run dev`: run the app in development mode, starting the local server with Parcel.
- `npm run build`: run the app in production mode, building the distributable files with Parcel.

## Service Worker

The service worker file is located at `src/sw.js`. It is loaded with the `ServiceWorker` component.

The file `sw.js` needs to remain in the root of the `src/` directory. (Do not move it!)

If you want to clear the client's cache storage and reinitialize the service worker, bump up the `version` in `sw.js`.

## Configure VS Code for Prettier

To seamlessly integrate VSCode with Prettier, create a new file `.vscode/settings.json` (if not existing already) and add the following code:

```
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "prettier.requireConfig": true,
  "editor.tabSize": 2
}
```
